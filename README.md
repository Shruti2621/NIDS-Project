# NIDS-Project
This project presents a Machine Learning-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) developed to accurately detect and classify diverse categories of malicious network activity. The system leverages the benchmark UNSW-NB15 dataset, comprising over 2.5 million records and 49 features, to train and evaluate various supervised learning models. The dataset is preprocessed through a series of steps including merging CSV files, removing irrelevant or null-valued columns, and selecting the top 50 features based on statistical importance.
A comparative analysis is performed using multiple machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Decision Tree, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. These models are trained to classify traffic into distinct categories such as DoS, Reconnaissance, Exploits, Generic, and Normal. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are used to assess performance, with Random Forest emerging as the most effective model.
The selected model is deployed through a Flask-based web application that facilitates real-time CSV file uploads for intrusion detection. The output includes a dashboard summarizing total connections, number of attacks, and detection rate; a pie chart representing attack distribution; and a structured table detailing predicted labels along with corresponding traffic attributes. This project highlights the practical application of machine learning in enhancing cybersecurity through intelligent and scalable intrusion detection systems.
